The five steps are as follows:
1. I have merged the tests and train for forming a  partial variables to create a dataset.
2. Retrieving means and std of columns
3. Adopted descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. A new dataset created containing means and std's.
5. Moeover, I have labelled the data set with descriptive variable names.
